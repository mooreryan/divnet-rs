# Examples

There are a couple of examples to help you get started in the [test_files](https://github.com/mooreryan/divnet-rs/tree/master/test_files) directory in this repository.

Check out how the config files and the input files look!

## Lee data comparison

For a comparison of the Lee dataset example given in the DivNet docs see [lee_data](./lee_data/README.md).

The `lee_data` directory also contains some R scripts that you can use as a starting point for getting your data out of R and in to `divnet-rs`, as well as getting the results back in to R.
