# Examples

There are a couple of examples to help you get started in the [test_files](https://github.com/mooreryan/divnet-rs/tree/master/test_files) directory in this repository.

Check out how the config files and the input files look!

There are also some [example scripts](TODO) for getting data out of R and into `divnet-rs` as well as for getting data from `divnet-rs` back in to R.
