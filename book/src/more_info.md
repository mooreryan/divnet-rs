# More useful information

For more background information and the theory behind DivNet, please check out the [original DivNet repository](https://github.com/adw96/DivNet) and the [DivNet manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxaa015).

You can find the `divnet-rs` source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/mooreryan/divnet-rs).

I wrote a [blog post](https://www.tenderisthebyte.com/blog/2021/01/18/divnet-rust-implementation/) introducing `divnet-rs`.  It it, I give more background information on the problems that DivNet attempts to solve and how it tries to solve them, talk a bit more about the differences in the Rust and R implementations, and do some benchmark comparisons between the two implementations.
