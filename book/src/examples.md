# Examples

There are a couple of examples to help you get started in the [test_files directory on GitHub](https://github.com/mooreryan/divnet-rs/tree/master/test_files).

In that directory, you will find a bunch of test data, input files, and config files.  You can use these to get an idea of what kind of input data `divnet-rs` needs.
