# divnet-rs

It's [DivNet](https://github.com/adw96/DivNet) with fewer features, but also *way* faster!!

Unfortunately, it is also more complicated to use at the moment, so if your data sets are smaller, I recommend using the [original implementation](https://github.com/adw96/DivNet).

Please see the [GitHub repository for the reference implementation](https://github.com/adw96/DivNet).  It has lots of good info about the theory behind DivNet!

## Installation & Usage

For installation and usage instructions, please see the [divnet-rs book](https://mooreryan.github.io/divnet-rs-book/).
