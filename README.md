# divnet-rs

It's [DivNet](https://github.com/adw96/DivNet) with fewer features, but also *way* faster!!

Unfortunately, it is also more complicated to use at the moment, so if your data sets are smaller, I recommend using the [original implementation](https://github.com/adw96/DivNet).

Please see the [GitHub repository for the reference implementation](https://github.com/adw96/DivNet).  It has lots of good info about the theory behind DivNet!

## Installation & Usage

See the [docs](./docs) directory included in this repository for information on
how to install and run `divnet-rs`, how to get your data from R (and possibly
phyloseq) into a format that `divnet-rs` can handle, and how to get your data
*back* into R so you can get on with your research!
