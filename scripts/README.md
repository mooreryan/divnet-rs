# Scripts

These are some quick little R scripts to help you get data out of R and into `divnet-rs`. 

Also, there is a script that gives you an example for how to import `divnet-rs` data back in to R so that you can do all your fun analyses!

They aren't the nicest R scripts ever, but it should get you started :)
